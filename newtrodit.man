[1mWhat is Newtrodit?[0m

 Newtrodit is a console-based text editor. As Windows doesn't include a console text editor, 
 Newtrodit is probably your best choice. The editor is designed to be minimalistic and easy to use.
 Even if it's keyboard-based, the keybindings are easy to remember due to the fact that they're
 similar to other applications.
 The main goal is having a noticeable efficiency increase when working.

 [38;2;207;50;68mCommand line usage[0m

 newtrodit [switches] [file1] [file2] [file3]...

      --convertnull, -n       Converts null characters to spaces.
      --converttab, -t        Converts tabs to spaces.
      --devmode, -d           Enables developer mode.
      --fontcolor, -f         Changes the font color.
      --help, -h              Opens this Newtrodit help manual.
      --lfunix, -n            Changes the line ending to UNIX (LF).
      --lfwin, -w             Changes the line ending to Windows (CRLF).
      --line, -l              Displays line number.
      --menucolor, -c [color] Changes Newtrodit's menus color.
      --mouse, -m             Enables mouse support.
      --syntax, -s [file]     Enables syntax highlighting.
      --version, -v           Shows Newtrodit's version.

 Unlike previous versions, switches can go at any position, before or after file/files.
 If a file is named exactly like a switch, add the prefix './' before the name to avoid Newtrodit interpreting
 it as a switch. Files are loaded in order, but the last file is the one that will be shown for edition.
 
 [1m[38;2;207;50;68mUsage inside application[0m

 [37;113;235;37;1mNavigation[0m


 Newtrodit offers navigation features which ease the file editing process.
 To move between lines and columns, you may use arrow keys. To go to the beginning of a line,
 use [1mEnd[0m and [1mHome[0m; to jump pages, [1mPageUp[0m and [1mPageDown[0m.
 The current cursor position is displayed at bottom left part of the screen,
 where [1mLn[0m means line and [1mCol[0m means column. The percentages indicate the
 position of the cursor inside the file.

   The function will search for a file only in the current directory.
   Additionally, you can use wildcards to perform an advanced search.
   Newtrodit will automatically detect if you are using wildcards and it will change the search path accordingly.
   
   The asterisk ([38;2;207;50;68;4m*[0m) can be used to replace any word of any length.
   The question mark ([38;2;207;50;68;4m?[0m) can be used to replace character of always length 1.

   The function will search for the first matches, displaying the date and time in the
   YYYY/MM/DD hh:mm:ss format. File size is shown in bytes.
    
   [37;113;235;37;1mExample[0m
  
    'hello' would match for example a file called 'myhello.txt' and 'hello.txt'
    'hello*' won't match 'myhello.txt', but '*hello*' will.
    'hello.???' will only match files with the name 'hello' and a 3 character extension.

     This wildcards have the same behavior as cmd.exe [1mDIR[0m command ones.

     Known issue: Correct file size displaying is limited to 4 GB due to 32-bit integer limitations.

   The command palette allows you to use commands in a Vim-like style instead of keybindings.
   For instance, some functions have multiple ways of being called, either via keybindings or
   via commands.

 Newtrodit can be customizable as you like it by changing some settings.

 Settings file must be located in the same directory as Newtrodit with the name '[1mnewtrodit.config[0m'.
 It's a simple text file with one line per setting, with an INI-like syntax.

 Comments are allowed in the settings file with the '[38;2;207;50;68m;[0m' (semicolon) character.

 [37;113;235;37;1mMultiple tabs[0m

 The big new feature introduced in Newtrodit 0.6 are tabs. With this feature, you can open up to
 $T files in the same Newtrodit window, by pressing [38;2;207;50;68;4mCtrl-N[0m. Tabs can be inserted or closed in any
 position, and it will shift the other tabs accordingly.
  
 You can switch between tabs by pressing [38;2;207;50;68;4mCtrl-TAB[0m (forward) and [38;2;207;50;68;4mCtrl-Shift-TAB[0m (backward), or
 by using the [1m@n[0m command in the command palette ([38;2;207;50;68;4mCtrl-P[0m), where [1mn[0m is the file index.
 
 All settings are shared between tabs (e.g: disabling line count will disable it for all open files)

 To close a tab, use [38;2;207;50;68;4mCtrl-W[0m or either [38;2;207;50;68;4mCtrl-F4[0m

 [37;113;235;37;1mCode autocompletion[0m

 Newtrodit includes a simple but functional code autocompletion module to increase your productivity.
 Autocompletion is limited to the word immediately to the left of the cursor. The algorithm treats only
 the word preceding the cursor for autocompletion. The rest of the line is not taken into account.
 
 The matching algorithm takes three different factors including length difference, word matching
 at the beginning and character matching at the middle. The result that gets the highest "score"
 is the autocompletion proposition, even though the matching should be high, otherwise nothing will happen.
 Autocompletion can be triggered by pressing the [38;2;207;50;68;4mTab[0m key.

 Keep in mind that only the keywords on the syntax highlighting scheme are filled. No variables,
 functions, or anything that require context analysis is checked.

 [37;113;235;37;1mLog file[0m

 Newtrodit keeps track of actions that could help in debugging a problem (loaded settings, exceptions...) into
 a file called '[1mnewtrodit.log[0m'.

 Note that only debugging information is written and no personal information or file content is ever saved.

[37;113;235;37;1mSyntax highlighting[0m

 Newtrodit has some syntax highlighting rules to color the code you're writing and to make it
 easier to read. 

 Syntax highlighting format is similar to the settings format (INI-like), but with some special keywords.
 Each line must start with a keyword followed by an equal sign and the color of the keyword.

 Here's a list of all special keywords:
 [1m $$NEWTRODIT_SYNTAX[0m = This must be the first line of the file to indicate the syntax
                      highlighting format used is the one used by Newtrodit.
                                  
 [1m $$LANGUAGE[0m           = This keyword indicates the language of the code.
 [1m $$COMMENT[0m            = This keyword the comment string.
 [1m $$COMMENT_COLOR[0m      = Comments color.
 [1m $$QUOTE_COLOR[0m        = String color.
 [1m $$DEFAULT_COLOR[0m      = Code that isn't highlighting will be colored in this color.
 [1m $$NUMBER_COLOR[0m       = Every number written will be colored in this color.
 [1m $$SEPARATORS[0m         = Code separator characters. (e.g. ',.()+-/*=~[];{}<> ')
 [1m $$CAPITAL[0m            = Enable capital words syntax highlighting. Use '0' to disable and '1' to enable.
 [1m $$CAPITAL_COLOR[0m      = Color for the highlighted capital words. Requires [1m$$CAPITAL[0m to be set to '1'.
 [1m $$CAPITAL_MIN[0m        = Minimum length for capital words to be highlighted. Requires [1m$$CAPITAL[0m to be set to '1'.

 [37;113;235;37;1mOld keybindings[0m

 Some keybindings can be changed using the [1moldkeybindings[0m setting.
 Here's a list of the replaced keybindings:

 [38;2;207;50;68;4mCtrl-X[0m --> [38;2;207;50;68;4mCtrl-Q[0m (Quit Newtrodit)
 [38;2;207;50;68;4mCtrl-K[0m --> [38;2;207;50;68;4mCtrl-X[0m (Cut line)

 If [1moldkeybindings[0m is enabled, both [38;2;207;50;68;4mCtrl-X[0m and [38;2;207;50;68;4mCtrl-Q[0m map to the same action (Quit Newtrodit)
 
 [37;113;235;37;1mDeveloper mode[0m

 Developer mode is a setting made for users who want to use test/debug features on Newtrodit.
 Features of developer mode:
  - Displaying line content ([38;2;207;50;68;4mCtrl-D[0m)
  - Displaying old and new console size ([38;2;207;50;68;4mF12[0m)

 To toggle developer mode, press '[38;2;207;50;68;4mCtrl-Shift-D[0m'

 [37;113;235;37;1mConfiguration priority[0m

  The setting that applies last has the highest priority.

  For example, writing 2 lines with the same setting will result in the second line
  being written with the second setting, ignoring the first one.

  Priority order (lowest to highest):
  - Newtrodit default settings
  - Settings file
  - Command line arguments
  - Inside application setting changing
  - Syntax highlighting (for colors scheme)

  Even if a color scheme has been defined in command line arguments, syntax highlighting will override
  the colored keywords.

 As all programs, Newtrodit isn't perfect. If you find a bug, please report it on:
 [1m$G/issues[0m

 Most common crash causes are:
  - Not enough memory available
  - Invalid settings file
  - Invalid or too large syntax highlighting scheme
  - Memory allocation error
  - Buffer overflow

 There are also more rare crashes, such as:
  - Memory/stack corruption
  - External program interferences (e.g. external programs that write memory to Newtrodit)
  
 If you find a crash, please report it with all the information on the crash screen.

 [37;113;235;37;1mInternal working[0m

 At the moment, Newtrodit has a buffer of $X x $Y. The maximum number of lines is
 $Y, with a buffer increment of $I, while line length depends on the memory available on the system.
 
 This is due to the fact that the buffer is a 2D array of characters. This is one of the main 
 issues that Newtrodit has to deal with and we're working on it.

 It has been coded in C to have maximum performance. At the moment, the Linux fork is being developped
 by Zackery Smith, called Newtrodit-LCL (Linux Compatibility Layer).

 Some more specific internal working behaviors:
  - New lines while reading a file are added when a '[38;2;207;50;68;4m\n[0m' character is found, 
    and not when a custom new line string is found.
