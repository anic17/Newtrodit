[1mWhat is Newtrodit?[0m
 
 Newtrodit is a console-based text editor. As Windows doesn't include a console text editor, 
 Newtrodit is probably your best choice. The editor is designed to be minimalistic and easy to use.
 It doesn't use the mouse, and even if it uses only keyboard keybinds, they're still easy to remember
 due to the fact that they're similar to other applications.
 Main goal is your efficency when working.

 [37;113;235;37;1mSettings[0m

 Newtrodit can be customizable as you like it by changing some settings.

 Settings file must be located in the same directory as Newtrodit with the name '[1mnewtrodit.config[0m'.
 It's a simple text file with one line per setting, with an INI-like syntax.

 Comments are allowed in the settings file with the '[38;2;207;50;68m;[0m' (semicolon) character.

   [1mBoolean[0m      = Boolean. This setting type stores a boolean value (either 1 or 0).

   In case that a boolean or an integer setting is not a valid value, 0 will be used by default.

 [1mSyntax highlighting[0m

 Newtrodit has some syntax highlighting rules to color the code you're writing and to make it
 easier to read. It's still in an experimental phase, so it's disabled by default.

 At the moment, there only exist some basic rules to highlight the C language, but at the future
 there will be more, adding you the possibility to customize the syntax highlighting and create your
 own rules. 

 [1mOld keybinds[0m

 Some keybinds can be changed using the[1m oldkeybinds[0m setting.
 Here's a list of the replaced keybinds:

 [38;2;207;50;68;4m^X[0m --> [38;2;207;50;68;4m^Q[0m
 [38;2;207;50;68;4m^K[0m --> [38;2;207;50;68;4m^X[0m
 
 [37;113;235;37;1mDeveloper mode[0m

 Developer mode is a setting made for users who want to use test/debug features on Newtrodit.
 Features of developer mode:
  - Displaying line content ([38;2;207;50;68;4m^D[0m)
  - Displaying old and new console size ([38;2;207;50;68;4mF12[0m)

 To toggle developer mode, press '[38;2;207;50;68;4m^S-D[0m'

 [37;113;235;37;1mInternal working[0m

 At the moment, Newtrodit has a buffer of $X x $Y. The maximum number of lines is
 $Y, and line length depends on the RAM of the computer.
 
 This is due to the fact that the buffer is a 2D array of characters. This is one of the main 
 issues that Newtrodit has to deal with and we're working on it.

 It has been coded in C to have maximum performance. At the moment it's only compatible with
 Windows because it uses the Windows API to display the GUI.

 Some more specific internal working behaviors:
  - New lines while reading a file are added when a '[38;2;207;50;68;4m\n[0m' character is found, 
  and not when a custom new line string is found.
